[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sinja-sequel.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sinja-sequel)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/mwpastore/sinja-sequel.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/mwpastore/sinja-sequel)

Sinja::Sequel configures your [Sinja][1] application to work with [Sequel][2]
out of the box, and provides additional helpers to greatly simplify the process
of writing the more complex action helpers (specifically `replace`, `merge`,
and `subtract`). An optional extension enhances Sinja's DSL to generate basic
action helpers that can be overridden, customized, or removed.

The core configuration and helpers are in pretty good shape (Sinja uses them in
its [demo app][3] and test suite), but the extension could use some fleshing
out. Testers and community contributions welcome!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sinja-sequel'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install sinja-sequel
```

## Best Practices

Always return Sequel datasets (instead of arrays of objects) from your `index`
(e.g. `Foo.dataset`) and `fetch` (e.g.  `resource.bars_dataset`) action
helpers. The `finalize` helper, described below, will ensure they are
"rasterized" before being passed to [JSONAPI::Serializers][5].

You'll want to enable Sequel's `:tactical_eager_loading` plugin for the best
performance with JSONAPI::Serializers. I've [seen][6] it reduce complex
serializations by a factor of 100 (i.e. quite literally one query instead of
100).

If you want to use client-generated IDs, enable the `:update_primary_key`
plugin on the model and call `unrestrict_primary_key` in the model definition
to allow mass assignment (e.g. with `Sequel::Model#set_fields`).

If your model has foreign keys and you want to enforce a non-nullable
constraint at the application level, consider enabling the
`:validation_helpers` plugin on the model and using `validates_not_null` in
conjuction with the `validate!` helper described below:

```ruby
class Bar < Sequel::Model
  plugin :validation_helpers

  def validate
    super
    validates_not_null :foo
  end
end
```

See "Avoiding Null Foreign Keys" in the [Sinja][1] documentation for more
information.

Finally, enable the `:pagination` extension on your connection (before
prepending Core) to enable pagination!

## Usage

Progressively opt-in to Sinja::Sequel's features by enabling (1) Core, (2)
Helpers and Core (the most common use-case), or (3) Extension, Helpers, and
Core. (Pagination is automatically enabled with Core, but may need to be
manually enabled under certain circumstances, detailed below.)

### Core

Prepend [Sinja::Sequel::Core](/lib/sinja/sequel/core.rb) after registering
Sinja:

```ruby
require 'sinja'
require 'sinja/sequel/core'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinja

  helpers do
    prepend Sinja::Sequel::Core
  end

  # ..

  freeze_jsonapi
end
```

Note that you must use `prepend` (instead of including Sinja::Sequel::Core like
a normal module of Sinatra helpers) in order to ensure that the included
methods take precedence over Sinja's method stubs (e.g. `transaction`).
[This][4] will hopefully be fixed in a future version of Sinatra.

Prepending Core has the following effects on your application:

* Configures `conflict_`, `not_found_`, and `validation_exceptions`, and
  `validation_formatter`.
* Defines a `database` helper that delegates to `Sequel::Model.db`.
* Defines a `transaction` helper that delegates to `database.transaction`.
* Defines a `validate!` helper that raises an error if `resource` is invalid
  after a `create` or `update` action helper invocation.
* Defines a simple equality-based `filter` helper that passes the filter params
  to `Sequel::Dataset#where`.
* Defines a `sort` helper that applies `Sequel.asc` and `Sequel.desc` to the
  sort terms and passes them to `Sequel::Dataset#order`.
* Defines a `finalize` helper that simply calls `Sequel::Dataset#all`.

If the `:pagination` Sequel extension is loaded, it also does the following:

* Configures `page_using` for page number- and size-based pagination, with an
  additional record count parameter to avoid repetitive `SELECT COUNT` queries
  while paging.
* Defines a `page` helper that calls `Sequel::Dataset#paginate` and computes a
  hash of page params that Sinja will use to construct the root pagination
  links and add to the root metadata of the response.

You may override any of the installed helpers by defining your own. Please see
the [Sinja][1] documentation for more information about Sinja hooks and
configurables, and the [Sequel][2] documentation for more information about
Sequel plugins and features.

### Helpers

Include
[Sinja::Sequel::Helpers](/lib/sinja/sequel/helpers.rb) after
registering Sinja:

```ruby
require 'sinja'
require 'sinja/sequel/helpers'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinja

  helpers Sinja::Sequel::Helpers

  # ..

  freeze_jsonapi
end
```

**Note that including Helpers will automatically prepend Core!**

#### `next_pk`

A convenience method to always return the primary key of the resource and the
resource from your `create` action helpers. Simply use it instead of `next`!

```ruby
create do |attr|
  next_pk Foo.create(attr)
end
```

#### `add_missing`

Take the key of a Sequel \*_to_many association and an array of resource
identifier objects and add the "missing" records to the collection. Makes
writing your `merge` action helpers a breeze!

```ruby
has_many :bars do
  merge do |rios|
    add_missing(:bars, rios)
  end
end
```

It will try to cast the ID of each resource identifier object by sending it the
`:to_i` method; pass in a third argument to specify a different method (e.g. if
the primary key of the `bars` table is a `varchar`, pass in `:to_s` instead).

This helper also takes an optional block that can be used to filter
subresources during processing. Simply return a truthy or falsey value from the
block (or raise an error to abort the entire transaction):

```ruby
has_many :bars do
  merge do |rios|
    add_missing(:bars, rios) do |bar|
      role?(:admin) || bar.owner == resource.owner
    end
  end
end
```

#### `remove_present`

Like `add_missing`, but removes the "present" records from the collection.
Makes writing your `subtract` action helpers a breeze!

#### `add_remove`

Like `add_missing` and `remove_present`, but performs an efficient delta
operation on the collection. Makes writing your `replace` action helpers a
breeze!

An optional block passed to this method will be used to filter both adds and
removes. To use different filters for the two operations, pass a hash of
callables (with keys `:add` and/or `:remove`).

### Extension

Register [Sinja::Sequel](/lib/sinja/sequel.rb) after
registering Sinja:

```ruby
require 'sinja'
require 'sinja/sequel'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinja
  register Sinja::Sequel

  # ..

  freeze_jsonapi
end
```

**Note that registering the extension will automatically include Helpers!**

After registering the extension, the `resource`, `has_many`, and `has_one` DSL
keywords will generate basic action helpers.

* `resource` and `has_many`, and `has_one` take an optional second argument
  that specifies the method to use to cast the ID of the resource or resource
  identifier object(s) (`:to_i` by default).

* The generated action helpers will be unrestricted by default.

* The generated `create` action helper does not support client-generated IDs.

These action helpers can be subsequently overridden, customized by setting
action helper options (i.e. `:roles`) and/or defining `before_<action>` hooks,
or removed entirely with `remove_<action>`.

Given a database connection and Foo, Bar, and Qux models and serializers,
here's an example "classic"-style application using the extension:

```ruby
require 'sinatra/jsonapi/sequel'

resource :foos do
  has_many :bars
  has_one :qux
end

resource :bars do
  has_one :foo
end

resource :quxes do
  has_many :foos
end

freeze_jsonapi
```

Pretty neat, huh?

### Pagination

Sinja::Sequel inspects the first Sequel database to determine whether or not to
enable pagination. If (and only if!) you have _multiple_ databases in your
application and only _some_ support pagination, you _may_ need to prepend
[Sinja::Sequel::Pagination](/lib/sinja/sequel/pagination.rb) after prepending
Core, including Helpers, or registering Sinja:

```ruby
require 'sinja'
require 'sinja/sequel'
require 'sinja/sequel/pagination'

DB = Sequel.connect ENV['DB_URL']

OTHER_DB = Sequel.connect ENV['OTHER_DB_URL']
OTHER_DB.extension :pagination

# Sequel::Model.db now points to DB, which does not support pagination, so
# pagination will not be automatically enabled. We'll point Sinja::Sequel at
# OTHER_DB instead, and manually enable pagination...

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinja
  register Sinja::Sequel

  helpers do
    prepend Sinja::Sequel::Pagination

    def database
      OTHER_DB
    end
  end

  # ..

  freeze_jsonapi
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
